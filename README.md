# Judo iOS SDK

Requirements:

- iOS SDK: iOS 14 or newer
- Xcode 13 or newer

# Install the SDK

The recommended way to install the Judo SDK is with SwiftPM.

To add the dependency to your project using Xcode (12 or later assumed), choose `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency`, and type the URL to this repository into the search field: `https://github.com/judoapp/judo-swiftui`

In this next prompt, you will be able to choose the default SwiftPM update policy. The Judo SDK uses the standard semver versioning strategy, so the default of "up to next major" is recommended. Leave the settings at their defaults and press Next.

It will prompt you to select which Judo products to add to your app target. Make sure you select **Judo**, and press Next.
